# Enhanced Terraforming Mars VP Tracking System

## Overview

We have successfully enhanced the Terraforming Mars scraper with comprehensive Victory Point (VP) tracking capabilities that extract accurate data directly from BoardGameArena's embedded game state rather than attempting to calculate it from moves.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Accurate VP Extraction
- **Direct Data Source**: Extracts VP data from embedded JSON structures in the HTML
- **Real-time Accuracy**: Uses the actual game engine calculations, not approximations
- **Complete Breakdown**: Tracks TR, milestones, awards, cards, cities, and greeneries separately

### 2. VP Progression Tracking
- **200 Data Points**: Captures VP state throughout the entire game
- **Move-by-Move Analysis**: Tracks how VP changes with each action
- **Award Leadership**: Monitors award position changes and flips
- **Strategic Timing**: Shows when key VP milestones are reached

### 3. Comprehensive Data Export
- **Enhanced JSON**: Complete game data with accurate VP tracking
- **VP Breakdown CSV**: Final VP sources per player
- **VP Progression CSV**: Move-by-move VP changes for analysis
- **Award Analysis**: Leadership changes and timing

## Example Results

From the test game (250604-1037):

### Final Accurate Scores
```
petersenhauke (Robinson Industries): 104 VP
  TR Rating: 51 VP
  Milestones: 15 VP (3 milestones claimed)
  Awards: 5 VP (1st place in 1 award)
  Cards: 6 VP
  Board Tiles: 27 VP (cities + greeneries)

StrandedKnight (Cheung Shing Mars): 43 VP
  TR Rating: 33 VP
  Milestones: 0 VP
  Awards: 0 VP
  Cards: 6 VP
  Board Tiles: 4 VP
```

### VP Progression Insights
- **Game Duration**: 200 VP data points tracked
- **VP Growth**: 40 â†’ 147 total VP (+107 over game)
- **Key Milestones**:
  - 50 VP reached at move 17
  - 100 VP reached at move 118
  - 125 VP reached at move 168
- **Award Leadership**: Player 86296239 took award_1 lead at move 63

### Strategic Analysis
- **petersenhauke Strategy**: High TR focus (51 VP) + strong tile game (27 VP)
- **StrandedKnight Strategy**: Balanced approach but lower overall execution
- **Award Competition**: Only one award contested with a single leadership change

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
1. **VP Data Extraction** (`_extract_vp_data_from_html`): Finds and parses embedded VP JSON
2. **VP Progression** (`extract_vp_progression`): Captures all VP states throughout game
3. **Player Mapping** (`_map_players_to_ids`): Links player names to internal IDs
4. **Export Functions**: Multiple output formats for different analysis needs

### Data Structures
- **VictoryPoints**: Complete VP breakdown per player
- **VP Progression**: Time-series VP data with metadata
- **Award Tracking**: Leadership changes and standings

### Export Formats
- **JSON**: Complete structured game data
- **CSV**: Tabular data for spreadsheet analysis
- **Progression CSV**: Time-series VP data for charting

## Files Created/Enhanced

### New Analysis Scripts
- `extract_vp_progression.py`: VP progression extraction and analysis
- `extract_complete_vp.py`: Final VP state extraction
- `test_enhanced_parser.py`: Comprehensive testing and demonstration

### Enhanced Core Files
- `src/parser.py`: Added VP extraction methods and data structures
- `src/card_vp_database.py`: Comprehensive card VP database (200+ cards)

### Output Files
- `data/parsed/vp_progression_250604-1037_final.csv`: Complete VP progression
- `data/parsed/vp_breakdown_250604-1037_final.csv`: Final VP breakdown
- `data/parsed/game_250604-1037_final.json`: Enhanced game data

## Strategic Insights Enabled

### Game Analysis
- **VP Source Analysis**: Which VP sources are most effective?
- **Timing Analysis**: When do players make key VP gains?
- **Award Competition**: How contested are different awards?
- **TR vs. Engine**: High TR vs. engine-building strategies

### Competitive Intelligence
- **Award Timing**: When to fund awards for maximum benefit
- **Milestone Racing**: Optimal timing for milestone claims
- **VP Efficiency**: Which actions provide best VP/resource ratio
- **Endgame Triggers**: When players push for game end

## Usage Example

```python
from src.parser import TMGameParser

parser = TMGameParser()
game = parser.parse_game_from_html(html_content, replay_id)

# Access accurate VP data
for player, vp in game.final_state.player_vp.items():
    print(f"{player}: {vp.total} VP")
    print(f"  TR: {vp.tr_rating}, Cards: {sum(vp.cards.values())}")

# Export VP progression for analysis
parser.export_vp_progression_to_csv(game, html_content, "vp_progression.csv")
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Generation Boundaries**: Detect exact generation breaks
2. **Card Timing**: Track when specific VP cards are played
3. **Resource Efficiency**: VP gained per resource spent
4. **Multi-Game Analysis**: Compare strategies across games
5. **Player Profiling**: Identify player strategy patterns

### Data Science Applications
- **Strategy Classification**: ML models to classify player strategies
- **Win Prediction**: Predict winners based on early game VP progression
- **Optimal Play**: Identify highest VP/turn actions
- **Meta Analysis**: Track strategy effectiveness over time

## Conclusion

This enhanced VP tracking system provides unprecedented insight into Terraforming Mars gameplay by extracting accurate, real-time VP data directly from the game engine. The progression tracking enables deep strategic analysis of timing, competition, and efficiency that was previously impossible with move-based approximations.

The system is now ready for large-scale game analysis, strategy research, and competitive intelligence gathering.
